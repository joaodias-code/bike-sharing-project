# Bike-sharing project

Development of a neural network to predict the number of daily bicycle rental trips. This project helps to predict, with historical data, how many bikes your company will need to have in stock to rent in the coming days.

Project built during the [Udacity deep learning course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).
